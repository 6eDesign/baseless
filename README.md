# BASELESS
[BASELESS](https://github.com/dhigginbotham/baseless) is a minimal UI framework is a good starting point for a basic or extensive website. 
It's currently being developed on and isn't quite ready for production, but here's what it does for you:

To start we're using [normalize.css](#) to get all of our browsers behaving in a way we expect. From there we use mixins to create reusable
and customizable components. To generate our styleguide we're using [kss-node](#), [gulp](#) and [less](#).
